
1
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:12,290
NEW YORK

2
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:19,755
The future.

3
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,387
A dark desolate world.

4
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,072
World in war,
suffering, loss ..

5
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,478
.. on both sides.

6
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:43,056
Mutants and the humans who dared help them,

7
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:50,463
fighting an enemy we can not defeat.

8
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,190
Are we destined on this path?

9
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:25,725
Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?

10
00:02:29,601 --> 00:02:34,130
or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves?

11
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,315
Change our fate?

12
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:45,379
Is the future truly set?

13
00:02:49,900 --> 00:03:00,093

14
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,187
They are here!

15
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:22,608
Time's-up !

16
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:23,714
Sentinel!

17
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:28,898
Sunspot.

18
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:34,935
Let's go!

19
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:05,473
Blink!

20
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:06,598
No!

21
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,956
It's too late, assholes !

22
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,674
<i>Come here!</i>

23
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:19,435
<i>Get your hands up!!</i>

24
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:20,790
<i>-Get down !!
-No!!!</i>

25
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,465
<i>No !!!</i>

26
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,020
So few of us left.

27
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:36,357
<i> Professor. </i>

28
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,070
We found them.

29
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:11,848
Professor.

30
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,729
-Bobby.
-Hi, Storm.

31
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,366
Hey, kid.

32
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:19,561
<i> Professor. </i>

33
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:21,864
You made it.

34
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,654
Whenever the Sentinels attack

35
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,083
Warpath spots them.

36
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,223
and I sent Bishop back to
warn us of the attack...

37
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,334
before it happens.

38
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:42,989
Blink scouts the next side and..

39
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,901
.. well then we leave before
they ever know we were there.

40
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:48,630
Because we never were.

41
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,669
What do you mean you've never  there?

42
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:53,323
She projects Bishop back in time few days...

43
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,369
to warn the others of the coming attack.

44
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:58,007
She sends Bishop back in time?

45
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,943
No, just his consciousness,
in to his younger-self

46
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,605
into his younger body.

47
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:03,967
Wow!

48
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,326
This not just work, Charles.

49
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,095
What might works?

50
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,020
The Sentinel program was originally conceived by Dr. Bolivar Trask.

51
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:20,383
In the early 70s he was one of the world leading weapons designers.

52
00:11:20,604 --> 00:11:24,997
But, covertly he had began experimenting only mutants.

53
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,178
Using their gifts to fuel his own research.

54
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,248
There was one mutant who had
discovered what he was doing.

55
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:38,602
Mutant with ability to
transform herself to anyone.

56
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:40,283
Mystique.

57
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,947
I knew her as  Raven.

58
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:46,444
We met when we were
children, grow up together.

59
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:49,710
She was like a sister to me.

60
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,675
I tried to help her.

61
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,477
But only succeeded in driving her away.

62
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:58,715
She hunted Trask across the world.

63
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:04,474
And at the Paris Peace of Accords in 1973
after the Vietnam War.

64
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,429
<i> She found Trask, </i>

65
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,651
And killed him.

66
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:18,813
It was the first time she killed him.

67
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,868
Wasn't no last.

68
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:24,148
But killing Trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

69
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,482
It only persuaded the government
the need for his program.

70
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,630
They captured her that day.

71
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,369
Tortured her and experimented on her.

72
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:39,467
In her DNA, they discovered the secret
to her power of transformation,

73
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,737
it gave them the key they needed,

74
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:45,797
to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant's power.

75
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,990
And less than 50 years,

76
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:53,185
the machines were destroyed so
many of our kind were created.

77
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,788
and It all started that day in 1973,

78
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:00,256
The day she first  killed,

79
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:03,644
<i> The day she truly became Mystique. </i>

80
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,016
Do you wanna go back there?

81
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:08,828
If I can get to her,

82
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,593
stop the assassination,

83
00:13:10,778 --> 00:13:12,353
keep her out of their hands,

84
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:15,902
And we can stop the Sentinels
ever been borne.

85
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,972
And end this war,
before it  ever begins.

86
00:13:23,414 --> 00:13:25,812
I can send someone back in couple of weeks.

87
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:30,914
Maybe a month, but you're talking about going back decades.

88
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:34,564
You have the most powerful brain the world, Professor.

89
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:37,818
<i> But the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps.</i>

90
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,912
<i>It will rip you apart.
I'm sorry. </i>

91
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,234
<i> No one can survive that trip. </i>

92
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,013
What if someone's mind has a
 way of sniping back.

93
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,279
What if someone can heal as
faster as rip apart.

94
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:19,091
<i>Okay, Spread out. </i>

95
00:14:19,378 --> 00:14:20,603
<i> Take you position.</i>

96
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:38,859
So I wake up in the my younger
body god knows where, then what?

97
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:42,275
You need to go to my house and find me,

98
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,243
convince me all of this.

99
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:46,964
Wouldn't you just be able to read my mind?

100
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:49,933
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

101
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:54,627
Logan, you have to do for me what I once did for you,

102
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:57,081
Lead me, guide me.

103
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,118
I was a very difference man then.

104
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,163
You have to be patient with me.

105
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:05,248
Patience  isn't my strongest suit.

106
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,561
You're  need me as well.

107
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:08,377
What?

108
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,894
After Mystique left Charles, she came with me,

109
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,064
and I set her on a dangerous path.

110
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:15,796
Darker path.

111
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:21,013
It's going to take the two of us side by side
at a time when we couldn't be further apart.

112
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:25,821
Great.

113
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:28,293
So where do I find you?

114
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,237
Oh..Its complicated.

115
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,432
Basically, your body goes to sleep,
only your mind travels back in time.

116
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,198
As long as you back there, past and present
will continue to coexist.

117
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,073
But once you wake up....

118
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:48,064
.. whatever you've done will take hold and become history.

119
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:50,982
And for the rest of us that will
be the only history that we know.

120
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,008
That will be like,
last 50 years never happened.

121
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,478
This world, this war.

122
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,981
The only person who'll
remember it,

123
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:01,138
...is you.

124
00:16:02,981 --> 00:16:07,348
Alright Logan, I need you to clear your
head and stay as calm as possible.

125
00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:08,371
What do you mean?

126
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,414
If your mind gets rocky, It will harder for me to hold you.

127
00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:13,508
You could start to slip between past and future.

128
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,629
What I need to get a little rocky ?

129
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,195
Think  peaceful thoughts.

130
00:16:18,642 --> 00:16:19,674
Peaceful thoughts.

131
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,231
Do you have any good news?

132
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:21,935
Well,

133
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,570
You don't really age so you'll
pretty much look the same.

134
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,052
You don't have much time in past.

135
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:31,038
Sentinels will find
us, they always do.

136
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:34,772
And this time we won't
be able to run or have no escape.

137
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,573
This is our last chance.

138
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,457
Do you really think this will work?

139
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:42,236
I have faith in him.

140
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:45,095
So do him right about his choice.

141
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:47,788
If he is young, It would
be no any better.

142
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:49,799
We'll know.

143
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,043
See you soon.

144
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,293
It might sting a little.

145
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:33,999
Holy Shit !!

146
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:42,184
It worked.

147
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:48,932
Hey, what's going on ?

148
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,930
-Gwen! Get dressed!
-Who are you?

149
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:52,210
Hey, I don't know what's going on.

150
00:18:52,252 --> 00:18:55,444
What's going on is you supposed to guard
your Boss's daughter, not screwing her.

151
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,337
I didn't sleep with her.

152
00:18:57,682 --> 00:18:58,694
-No?
-No.

153
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,442
I mean, yes
I slept with her many times, but...

154
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:03,200
Jimmy!

155
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,597
That wasn't me. That was old me.

156
00:19:06,435 --> 00:19:09,383
-I just got here like 20 seconds ago.
-Really?

157
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:10,998
-Yeah.
-What happen to your cloths?

158
00:19:11,045 --> 00:19:12,237
No...Oh..

159
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:16,389
Will you believe me if I told you
I've sent here from the future?

160
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:20,334
-Get out of here, Sweetheart.
-Yeah

161
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:21,689
We'll take care of this comedian.

162
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,378
No you not.

163
00:19:22,492 --> 00:19:24,630
You gonna give me the keys of your car  and money for gas

164
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:26,287
or you gonna wake up in a hospital.

165
00:19:26,377 --> 00:19:27,986
Trust me, I know how these things pay out.

166
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:30,398
-Because you from the future?
-No,

167
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:32,899
...because of these.

168
00:19:34,557 --> 00:19:35,885
What the hell!!

169
00:19:41,736 --> 00:19:42,666
Ahhh...Damn it.

170
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,472
Peaceful thoughts.

171
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,209
<i> We are reviewing all of our defense expenditures</i>

172
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,388
<i> and all the black books are being opened. </i>

173
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:29,190
<i> We can't support a weapon that
targets our own citizens </i>

174
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,599
If these mutants as you described,

175
00:20:31,725 --> 00:20:35,468
Already living among us,
then they are living here peacefully.

176
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:38,918
- We haven't had an incident in over 10 years.
-After what happened in cuba?

177
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,348
It was never confirmed.

178
00:20:40,384 --> 00:20:42,633
We have real enemies out there.

179
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,314
Russians, The Chinese.

180
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:49,318
We're talking about 10 of 10 of the 10
of our population.

181
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:52,983
-Allow me to read something to you.
-Please.

182
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,217
This was acquired by our
friends at the CIA.

183
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,536
Its in a dissertation,

184
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,200
written by a mutant
at Oxford University.

185
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:03,083
And I quote.

186
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:08,475
<i>To Homo-neanderthals his a
mutant cousin of Homo Saphiens,</i>

187
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:09,963
<i>Which is us.</i>

188
00:21:10,314 --> 00:21:11,645
Was an aberration,

189
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:15,719
 the arrival of mutated human
species: Homo Saphiens.

190
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:19,935
was followed by the immediate extinction
of the their less evolve kin.

191
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:21,162
Well,

192
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,248
Now..

193
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:26,372
 We are the <i> Neanderthals.</i>

194
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:28,634
Speak for  yourself,  Dr.. Trask.

195
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:35,497
<i> You know when you send our soldiers to Vietnam without the weapon they needed to win the war</i>

196
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:37,507
<i> you underestimated your enemy. </i>

197
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,043
You, hah you do that with this enemy,

198
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:45,210
It won't be some border skirmish
halfway around the world.

199
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,093
<i> This time the war will be for our
streets, our cities, our homes.</i>

200
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:53,004
And by the time you see
the need for my program,

201
00:21:54,498 --> 00:21:55,726
it will be too late.

202
00:21:56,881 --> 00:22:00,521
And you will have lost two
wars in one life time.

203
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,147
We're sorry, Dr.. Trask.

204
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,669
But your Sentinel Program,

205
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:11,067
It ain't gonna fly.

206
00:22:23,587 --> 00:22:25,329
Can I help you, Colonel?

207
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:28,188
Just here to give my
boys to proper send off.

208
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:31,619
I'm sorry, sir. But we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

209
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,522
Stand a side, soldier.
That's an order.

210
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,356
Attention.

211
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:48,444
At ease.

212
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,862
What is all this?

213
00:23:12,988 --> 00:23:16,338
Lab reports, blood tests. All are
getting packed up and send back.

214
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,620
Where is it going?

215
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,019
Same place as they are.

216
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,628
Trask Industries.

217
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:23,849
Lets go gentleman

218
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:25,647
Taking you out of this shit show.

219
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:27,647
Shipping home?

220
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,401
Not just yet.

221
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:32,890
What do you doing with those?

222
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:34,586
Its only make the ride little smoother.

223
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:37,516
We are transferring you to a
private facility, where we can..

224
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,937
run a few more tests.

225
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,469
Your men are not military.

226
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:51,398
Private outfit.
We're authorized to command these men.

227
00:23:55,312 --> 00:23:57,075
These troops are going home.

228
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:58,556
Well, colonel...

229
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,882
I don't believe you have the
jurisdiction in this matter.

230
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,077
I'm afraid I do it, son.

231
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,530
I'm sorry who are you?

232
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:08,491
The question is, Major.

233
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,796
Who are you?

234
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:00,207
Raven.

235
00:25:00,903 --> 00:25:02,114
That's not my name.

236
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:10,690
-I had him.
-I know.

237
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:14,478
Let's move out.
Com-on let's go.

238
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,085
Where's Erik?

239
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:17,638
I'm on my own now.

240
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:21,819
Let's go. Move it.

241
00:25:39,516 --> 00:25:40,844
Hold that plane!

242
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:44,722
I wanna leave these boys in this
godforsaken country

243
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:45,598
Let's go.

244
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,194
You're not coming with us, are you?

245
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,950
My war is not over.
The enemy is still out there.

246
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,005
Where did they go?

247
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,440
Four cadets where they go?

248
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:18,857
They went over there.

249
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:44,015
PRIVATE PROPERTY
KEEP OUT

250
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:50,015
XAVIER'S SCHOOL

251
00:27:18,401 --> 00:27:19,182
Can I help you?

252
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:21,924
Ahh Yeah what happened to the School?

253
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:24,034
School has been shut for years.

254
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:25,448
Are you a parent?

255
00:27:26,018 --> 00:27:27,034
Sure as hell hope not.

256
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:29,361
-Who are you?
-I'm Hank.

257
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:31,604
I and Maccoy,  look
after the house now.

258
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:34,307
You are Beast?

259
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,020
Look at you, guess you are a late bloomer.

260
00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:40,332
I do not know what you're talking about.
I'm  gonna have to ask you to leave.

261
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,371
-Where is the professor?
-There is no professor here.

262
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:45,311
You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid.

263
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:48,199
Sure there is no Beast thing  here?

264
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,757
-Come on, Beast.
-Beast is not here.

265
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:50,944
-Come on, Beasty.
-Go!

266
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,302
Hey!!

267
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,645
I said, the school is closed.
You need to leave.

268
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:58,090
Not until I see the professor.

269
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,274
There is no professor here.
I told you that.

270
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,460
Look, kid.
You and I gonna be good friends.

271
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,654
You just don't know what yet.

272
00:28:11,035 --> 00:28:11,897
Professor!

273
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:14,163
Ahhh.....

274
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,847
Professor!

275
00:28:35,474 --> 00:28:38,021
Hank, what's going on here?

276
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,373
-Professor.
-Please do not call me that.

277
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,037
Do you know this guy?

278
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:46,576
Yeah he looks slightly familiar

279
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:48,365
Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank.

280
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:51,657
You can walk.

281
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,176
You're a perceptive one.

282
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:54,202
I thought Erik ..

283
00:28:54,402 --> 00:28:57,522
What you saying managed to
miss our sign on the way in

284
00:28:57,632 --> 00:29:01,741
This is private property my friend, i'm
gonna ask him to ask you to leave.

285
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:05,811
Well, I'm afraid I can't do that because...

286
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,137
..because I was sent here for you

287
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:12,825
Well, tell whoever it was that sent you that I'm busy.

288
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,297
This gonna be a little tricky,
because the person who sent me..

289
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:18,539
was you.

290
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:20,875
-What?
-About 50 years from now.

291
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:23,926
50 years from now, like in the
future 50 years from now.

292
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:24,207
Yeah.

293
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,103
-I sent you from the future.
-Yeah.

294
00:29:26,838 --> 00:29:27,569
Piss off.

295
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,342
If you had your powers,
you know I was telling the truth.

296
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,440
How do you know I don't have my.....

297
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,354
-Who are you?
-I told you.

298
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,940
-You are CIA?
-No.

299
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:38,904
You were watching me.

300
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:39,983
I know you, Charles.

301
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:42,390
We've been friends  for years.

302
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:45,359
I know your powers came when you were 9.

303
00:29:45,928 --> 00:29:50,162
I know you thought, you were going crazy when
it started, all the voices in your head.

304
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:54,560
and it wasn't until you were 12 that you realized
all the voices were in everyone else's head.

305
00:29:55,405 --> 00:29:56,497
Do you want me to go on?

306
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:00,126
I never told that anyone.

307
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,161
Not yet no but, you'll.

308
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:07,650
Alright you've picked my
interest, what do you want?

309
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:10,386
We have to stop Raven.

310
00:30:12,455 --> 00:30:14,423
I need your help.

311
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:17,008
We need your help.

312
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:24,024
Think I'd like to wake up now.

313
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:30,989
What does she have to do with this?

314
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:38,538
So, you're saying that they
took raven's power and what?

315
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:41,800
They weaponized it?

316
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:42,791
Yep

317
00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:45,008
She is unique.

318
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:46,783
Yes, she is.

319
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,610
In the beginning the sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

320
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,521
Then they began to identify
the genetics in non-mutants.

321
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:58,291
Who would eventually have mutant
children or grandchildren

322
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:01,618
Many of the humans tried to help us,
it was a slaughter

323
00:31:02,004 --> 00:31:04,301
Leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge

324
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:06,730
But then it went worse.

325
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:10,601
I've never seen anything like this.

326
00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:13,359
And it all starts with her.

327
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:16,418
Let's just say that for the sake of,

328
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:20,597
Sake that I choose to believe
you, that I choose to help you.

329
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:22,551
Raven won't listen to me.

330
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:28,423
No her heart and soul belongs
to someone else now.

331
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,960
I know.

332
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,996
That's why we gonna need Magneto, too.

333
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:36,013
Erik?

334
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:38,484
You do know where he is?

335
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:39,567
Yeah.

336
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:46,983
He's where he belongs.

337
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:49,550
So that's it, you're just gonna walk out?

338
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:52,129
Oh top marks, like I said,
you are perceptive.

339
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:54,159
The professor I know would
never turn his back

340
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:55,676
..on someone who lost their path

341
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:57,854
Especially someone he loved.

342
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:01,730
You know..

343
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:03,993
I think I do remember you now.

344
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:08,217
Yeah, we came to you a long
time ago seeking your help.

345
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,233
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then,

346
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,941
Fuck off!

347
00:32:16,442 --> 00:32:19,557
Listen to me you little
shit, I've come a long way,

348
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:22,207
and I watched a lot of people die,
good people, friends.

349
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,760
if you're gonna wallow in
self pity and do nothing,

350
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:28,082
Then you're gonna watch the
same thing, you understand?

351
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:34,954
We all have to die some time.

352
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:42,300
I told you, there is
no professor here.

353
00:32:44,252 --> 00:32:45,398
What the hell happened to him?

354
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:56,318
<i> He lost everything.
Erik, Raven, his legs. </i>

355
00:32:56,654 --> 00:33:00,550
The school allowed us this whole place

356
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,951
Just after the first semester,

357
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:05,725
The war
in Vietnam got worse.

358
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:10,411
Many of the teachers and
students were drafted.

359
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,421
It really broke him.

360
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:14,932
<i> He retreated into himself.. </i>

361
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,716
<i>I wanted to help do something so.. </i>

362
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:20,003
<i> So I designed a serum to
treat his spine, </i>

363
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:24,420
<i> Derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation. </i>

364
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:28,124
I take just enough to
keep myself balanced but,

365
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,218
he takes too much.

366
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,546
I tried easing him back but he
just couldn't bear the pain

367
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:36,880
Voices..

368
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:40,016
The treatment gives
him him his legs but

369
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,028
It's not enough

370
00:33:42,983 --> 00:33:43,851
He's..

371
00:33:46,446 --> 00:33:48,380
He's just lost too much.

372
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:04,214
<i> You're not scare to me? </i>

373
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,735
<i>I always believed I couldn't be
the only one in the world.</i>

374
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,647
<i> Charles Xavier. </i>

375
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:13,263
Raven .

376
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,238
You're hungry and alone?

377
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,675
Take whatever you want.

378
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,026
We got lots of food, you
don't have to steal. .

379
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:26,049
In-fact, you never have to steal again.

380
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,756
<i>And that's a promise. </i>

381
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:35,745
I hope you get her.

382
00:34:38,186 --> 00:34:41,286
but not for any of your
future shots but for her .

383
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:42,341
Fare enough.

384
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:46,174
I'm telling you this, you do not know Erik.

385
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,674
The man is a monster.
A murderer.

386
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:51,485
You think you can convince Raven to change?

387
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:52,777
To come home?

388
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,396
Splendid.

389
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:58,488
But what makes you think
you can change the him?

390
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:01,425
Because you and Erik
sent me here back together.

391
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:09,498
The room they're holding him in was built during the
2nd world war when there was a shortage of steel

392
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:13,171
So the foundation is pure
concrete and sand, no metal.

393
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:16,961
And he's being held a 100
floors beneath the most,

394
00:35:16,997 --> 00:35:19,450
Heavily guarded building on the planet.

395
00:35:19,612 --> 00:35:20,601
Why is he in there?

396
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:23,957
What, he forgot to mention?

397
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:26,994
Ahhh JFK.

398
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,736
He  killed him?

399
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:33,060
What else would explain the bullet
miraculously curving through the air,

400
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:34,977
Eric's always had a way with guns.

401
00:35:35,421 --> 00:35:37,130
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

402
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,729
This is your plan, not mine.

403
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:41,710
We don't have any resources to get us in,
or out

404
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:44,335
It's just me and Hank.

405
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:45,834
I know a guy.

406
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:49,067
Yeah, he'd be a young man now
grew up outside of DC

407
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,836
He could get into anywhere,

408
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,148
 just don't know how the
hell we're gonna find him

409
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,146
History provided the question

410
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,321
We have a phone book

411
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:12,893
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip, sir.

412
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:15,056
I just came to grab couple of files.

413
00:36:15,494 --> 00:36:16,641
Is that a new scarf?

414
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,490
It's nice.

415
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:19,850
Thank you.

416
00:37:26,064 --> 00:37:28,200
AUTOPSY REPORTS

417
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,603
Dr. Trask.

418
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:53,563
One second.

419
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:58,173
We added some names to the Paris meeting

420
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:02,746
Thank you.

421
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:06,034
Is there something wrong, sir?

422
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:07,479
No.

423
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:08,908
It's nothing.

424
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:11,282
Would you mind typing up my itinerary.

425
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,576
I don't wanna miss anything.

426
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:47,020
What has he done now?

427
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,916
-I'll just write you a check for whatever he took.
-We just need talk to him.

428
00:38:52,365 --> 00:38:55,587
Peter, the cops are here..

429
00:38:55,787 --> 00:38:56,858
.. again.

430
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:06,483
Guess what, I didn't do anything

431
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:07,404
I've been here all day.

432
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:11,144
Just relax Peter, we are not  cops.

433
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:13,383
Of course you're not cops, if you were
cops you wouldn't drive a rental car

434
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:14,784
How'd you know we got a rental car?

435
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,529
I checked your registration when you
were walking through the door,

436
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:19,700
I also had some time to kill so I went through your
rental agreements, saw you were from out of town

437
00:39:19,962 --> 00:39:20,986
Are you FBI?

438
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:25,085
No, you're not cops, hey what's
up with this kid's school place

439
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,391
That's an old card.

440
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:28,845
He is fascinating

441
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,895
He is a pain in the ass.

442
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:30,881
What teleporter?

443
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:32,217
No, He's just fast.

444
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:35,265
When I know him he was
so old. Young.

445
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,173
Young?
You're just old.

446
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:40,178
So you're not afraid to show your powers?

447
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:42,261
Power? What power? What
you talking about?

448
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,272
You see some strange here?

449
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:47,949
Nothing anybody believe if you told them.

450
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:53,066
So who are you?
What do you want?

451
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,400
We need your help, Peter.

452
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,098
What?

453
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:57,921
Break into a highly secured facility

454
00:39:57,989 --> 00:39:59,157
and get someone out.

455
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:00,039
Prison break?

456
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,856
That's illegal, you know.

457
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,854
Well, only if you get caught.

458
00:40:08,494 --> 00:40:09,388
What's there in for me?

459
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:12,931
You, the kleptomaniac, get
to break into the pentagon.

460
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:20,289
How do I know I can trust you?

461
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:22,874
Because we are just like you.

462
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,313
Show him.

463
00:40:38,323 --> 00:40:39,636
It's cool, just disgusting

464
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:46,361
Built in 1943, the Pentagon is the
world largest office building.

465
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:51,558
Housing more than 25000 military and police
stretched over 6 million square feet.

466
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:55,337
Where  is the bathroom?
<i>I need to pee. </i>

467
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,170
Well, lucky for you, you have...

468
00:41:22,348 --> 00:41:23,410
Thank you.

469
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,965
No Metal Beyond This Point.

470
00:41:58,654 --> 00:42:01,127
Yeah, we getting broadcast signal down here?
What's going on?

471
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:02,814
Damn it !! Call the maintenance,
get them down here.

472
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:57,519
MIND THE GLASS

473
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:43,808
<i>....from a Japanese empire.</i>

474
00:43:44,169 --> 00:43:45,734
<i>This month long battle...</i>

475
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:49,106
<i>included some of the fearsome
fighting during world war II</i>

476
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:07,025
In 3 seconds those doors are going to open,

477
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,724
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

478
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:12,310
I know, that's what i'm waiting for

479
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:13,537
What are you doing?

480
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:15,483
I'm holding your neck so
you won't get whip-lash

481
00:44:15,638 --> 00:44:16,185
What?

482
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:19,015
Whip.....la..sh

483
00:44:23,588 --> 00:44:24,316
They're in.

484
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:41,009
You're good. It'll pass.

485
00:44:41,189 --> 00:44:42,908
It happens when I run.

486
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:46,109
Must have done something pretty serious.

487
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,396
What're you do, man?
What you do.

488
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:51,894
What're you do?
Why would they have you in there.

489
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:53,029
For killing the president.

490
00:44:58,505 --> 00:45:01,703
Anything i'm guilty of is fighting
for people like us

491
00:45:01,997 --> 00:45:03,917
You take Karate?
You're a Karate man?

492
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:05,611
I don't know Karate.

493
00:45:06,265 --> 00:45:07,273
 I know crazy.

494
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:11,713
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
this is a code red situation

495
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:17,178
We are evacuating the entire floor so that we,
my uh associate and I can uh

496
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:18,516
- Secure the prisoner.
- Who are you?

497
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:23,404
We are special operations
CB, FE, CIED look,

498
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,514
Perhaps you didn't hear
me what first I spoke

499
00:45:25,575 --> 00:45:29,015
It's imperative that you understand
we're in complete lock down situation.

500
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,783
We have to get in to the 3rd floor

501
00:45:38,162 --> 00:45:39,612
Oh, I'm sorry, you want to finish?

502
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:46,879
They told me you can control the metal.

503
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:47,937
They?

504
00:45:51,442 --> 00:45:54,454
You know my mom once knew a
guy who could do that.

505
00:45:56,947 --> 00:46:00,148
Sorry, I'm just not very
good with violence.

506
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:04,010
Charles.

507
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:12,929
Good to see you too, old friend.

508
00:46:12,996 --> 00:46:15,679
-And walking?
-Not thanks to you.

509
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:20,152
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

510
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:23,501
Believe me, I wouldn’t
be here if I didn't have to.

511
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,747
If we get you out of here we do it my way,

512
00:46:25,932 --> 00:46:26,843
No killing.

513
00:46:27,043 --> 00:46:27,932
No helmet.

514
00:46:28,695 --> 00:46:30,554
I couldn't disobey you even if I want to.

515
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:33,468
I'm never getting inside
of that head again.

516
00:46:34,874 --> 00:46:36,546
I need your word, Erik.

517
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,275
No body move!

518
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:43,250
Move it, right there!

519
00:46:45,689 --> 00:46:46,806
Charles.
<i> Don't move! </i>

520
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:49,874
Hands up or we'll shoot!

521
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:51,202
-Freeze them, Charles.
-I can't.

522
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,152
Hands up!

523
00:46:57,753 --> 00:46:57,962
No!

524
00:47:11,766 --> 00:47:15,787

536
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:52,550
Thanks kid.

537
00:48:57,797 --> 00:48:59,961
Peter, thank you very very much.

538
00:49:00,332 --> 00:49:01,215
You take care.

539
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:03,429
Yeah, safe flight man, *****,
why you want to go Paris?

540
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:16,787
Imagine if they made of metal.

541
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,193
Do me a favor and return it for me, okay.

542
00:49:20,273 --> 00:49:21,101
Peter...

543
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:23,070
Take it slowly.

544
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:25,921
Where did they dig you up?

545
00:49:27,618 --> 00:49:30,352
You're gonna find this
hard to believe, but ahh..

546
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:32,370
You sent me.

547
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,683
You and Charles,

548
00:49:35,229 --> 00:49:36,518
from the future.

549
00:49:59,478 --> 00:50:00,494
How did you lose them?

550
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:04,002
The treatment for my spine fixed my DNA.

551
00:50:06,657 --> 00:50:08,974
You sacrificed your powers
that you could walk?

552
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:12,415
I sacrificed my power so that I could st..

553
00:50:15,922 --> 00:50:16,856
What do you know about it?

554
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:18,973
I lost my fair share, hah.

555
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:21,226
Try your eyes, Erik.

556
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:23,370
It doesn't justify what you've done.

557
00:50:23,534 --> 00:50:25,222
You've no idea what I have done.

558
00:50:25,343 --> 00:50:27,362
I know that you took the
things that mean most to me.

559
00:50:27,517 --> 00:50:29,559
Well, maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

560
00:50:29,966 --> 00:50:32,973
Do you want to fight, Erik?
I'll give you a fight !!

561
00:50:33,058 --> 00:50:35,339
-Let him come.
-You abandoned me!

562
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:38,104
You took her away and you abandoned me!

563
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:38,987
Angel.

564
00:50:39,596 --> 00:50:40,604
Azazel.

565
00:50:41,729 --> 00:50:42,601
Emma.

566
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:44,339
Banshee.

567
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:49,453
Mutant brothers and sisters all dead!

568
00:50:52,313 --> 00:50:53,501
Congress on this

569
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:55,496
..experimented on, butchered

570
00:50:55,696 --> 00:50:56,282
Erik.

571
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:57,577
Where were you, Charles?

572
00:50:58,547 --> 00:51:00,276
We were supposed to protect them!

573
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,372
Where were you your own people needed you?

574
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,552
Hiding!

575
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:08,069
You and Hank, pretending you
were something you're not

576
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:09,340
Erik.

577
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:14,138
You abandon us all.

578
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:35,802
So you were always an asshole

579
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:41,553
I take it we're best buddies in the future

580
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,337
I spent a lot of years trying
to bring you down, bub

581
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:48,513
How is that work out for you?

582
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:50,232
You're like me.

583
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:52,861
You're a survivor.

584
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,713
You wanna pick all that shit up?

585
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:03,265
Paris

586
00:52:21,494 --> 00:52:22,649
Excuse me.

587
00:52:23,103 --> 00:52:26,846
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

588
00:52:39,517 --> 00:52:42,155
Wanna play a game? It's been a while.

589
00:52:42,254 --> 00:52:43,808
I'm not in emotion for a game.

590
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:53,103
Haven't had a real sip in 10 years.

591
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:07,830
I didn't kill the president.

592
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:10,633
Bullet curved, Erik.

593
00:53:11,246 --> 00:53:12,807
Because I was trying to save him.

594
00:53:14,237 --> 00:53:15,832
They took me out before I could.

595
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:18,380
-Why would you trying to save him?
-Because he was one of us.

596
00:53:30,565 --> 00:53:33,047
You must think me so foolish.

597
00:53:34,932 --> 00:53:36,885
We always said they would come after us.

598
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:39,830
I never imagined they would
use Raven's DNA to do it.

599
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:42,976
When did you last see her?

600
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:47,595
The day I left to Dallas.

601
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,065
And how is she?

602
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:53,257
Strong.

603
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:55,215
Driven

604
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:57,881
-Loyal.
-How..

605
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,835
How was she?

606
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,313
She was..

607
00:54:09,888 --> 00:54:12,533
I could see why she had so much talent.

608
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:16,854
You should be proud of her, Charles.

609
00:54:18,587 --> 00:54:20,334
She is out there fighting for our cause.

610
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:21,517
Your cause.

611
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,250
The girl I knew, she was
not capable of killing.

612
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:27,250
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

613
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,582
She couldn't stay a little girl forever
that's why she left

614
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:33,019
She left because you got inside her head

615
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,749
That's not my power.

616
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:39,713
She made a choice.

617
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:42,403
But now we know where that
choice leads, don't we?

618
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,730
She's going to murder trask,
they're going to capture her,

619
00:54:45,857 --> 00:54:47,916
and then they're going to wipe us out.

620
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:50,436
Not if we get to her first.

621
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:53,694
Not if we change history tomorrow.

622
00:54:59,316 --> 00:55:00,408
I'm sorry, Charles.

623
00:55:05,411 --> 00:55:08,408
For what happened, I truly am

624
00:55:11,816 --> 00:55:14,019
It's been a while since I played

625
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:18,651
I'll go easy on you.

626
00:55:20,598 --> 00:55:21,826
Might finally get a fair fight.

627
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:24,581
You make the first move.

628
00:55:39,744 --> 00:55:42,713
The diplomats from all around the
world arriving here today at the

629
00:55:42,747 --> 00:55:44,485
 <i> hotel Royale.</i>

630
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:47,740
<i> It's a historic day as the official ending of, </i>

631
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:50,419
<i> the united states fierce
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

632
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:55,128
There's the south Vietnamese foreign minister
with other south vietnamese dignitaries

633
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,017
The summit doesn't begin for another hour

634
00:55:58,363 --> 00:56:01,626
The hotel has arranged a private room
upstairs for you, special quest

635
00:56:01,698 --> 00:56:02,782
That'll be fine.

636
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:07,108
Good afternoon, everyone, hello.

637
00:56:07,176 --> 00:56:08,330
Thank you for coming.

638
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,976
Congratulations on winning this war.

639
00:56:12,051 --> 00:56:16,348
Now I know you all have hands to
shake and photos to take downstairs,

640
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:18,101
So I will get right to the point.

641
00:56:19,596 --> 00:56:21,689
There is a new enemy out there.

642
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,884
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless,

643
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,235
Your armies powerless and
your nations defenseless.

644
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:35,510
<i> You'll need a new weapon for this war.</i>

645
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:37,678
<i> I call them "Sentinels". </i>

646
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:43,915
Named after the ancient guardians
that stood at the gates of the citadel.

647
00:56:45,622 --> 00:56:48,505
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a Harrier Jet.

648
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,390
Armed with guns that can fire off,

649
00:56:51,452 --> 00:56:55,447
<i> more than 2000 rounds per minute with
thermo-ceramic ammunition.</i>

650
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,670
But size, power, speed,

651
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,836
<i> You can find that at Lockheed above. </i>

652
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:03,645
<i> No, what makes the
sentinels so special?</i>

653
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:06,791
<i> Is the ability to target
the mutant X gene? </i>

654
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:11,808
The genetic guidance system that can
lock onto a mark half a mile away.

655
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:15,233
And won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

656
00:57:15,288 --> 00:57:18,049
With this weapon there'll be
no human collateral damage.

657
00:57:18,783 --> 00:57:21,197
If I turn it on the system
couldn't even activate in here.

658
00:57:29,222 --> 00:57:29,930
<i> Unless... </i>

659
00:57:30,863 --> 00:57:32,822
...there's a mutant.

660
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:44,161
There has to be some kind of mistake.

661
00:57:46,256 --> 00:57:48,631
My machine don't make mistakes.

662
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:52,167
What are you?

663
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:54,667
I assure you

664
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:57,556
I ..

665
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:58,489
No.Don't shoot him.

666
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,032
<i> I assure you. </i>

667
00:58:00,115 --> 00:58:00,760
Do not arrest him.

668
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:01,834
I do not know what  you're talking about.

669
00:58:36,477 --> 00:58:37,258
<i> Raven! </i>

670
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:43,506
Raven.

671
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:43,958
Raven.

672
00:58:44,084 --> 00:58:45,060
Raven!

673
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:49,614
Raven.

674
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:53,175
Charles.

675
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:55,665
We've come for you.
Erik and I.

676
00:58:56,193 --> 00:58:57,217
Together.

677
00:58:58,029 --> 00:59:00,122
<i>I never thought I could
see you again. </i>

678
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:03,763
<i>I made you a promise long time
ago that I would protect you.</i>

679
00:59:03,811 --> 00:59:06,616
<i>I didn't. And I know...</i>

680
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:12,875
<i> Wolverine! </i>

681
00:59:17,076 --> 00:59:19,551
I'm going to keep you safe
I'm going to keep you out of their hands

682
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:24,456
Erik.

683
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:27,175
Erik.

684
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:28,811
What are you doing?

685
00:59:30,085 --> 00:59:31,729
Securing our future.

686
00:59:31,816 --> 00:59:33,249
Forgive me, Mystique.

687
00:59:34,215 --> 00:59:36,832
Ss long as you're out there
we'll never be safe.

688
00:59:38,364 --> 00:59:39,269
Erik.

689
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,312
Use your powers, Charles.
Stop him.

690
00:59:41,518 --> 00:59:42,227
He can't.

691
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,830
He is slipping.
He is slipping back.

692
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,180
<i>I'm loosing him.</i>

693
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,800
<i> Striker! </i>

694
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:01,837
<i> This is where you started
as Wolverine, okay? </i>

695
01:01:03,845 --> 01:01:04,352
<i>  Kitty! </i>

696
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:08,606
Restrain him.

697
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:24,788
Erik!

698
01:01:35,314 --> 01:01:36,372
Where am I?

699
01:01:36,511 --> 01:01:36,972
Ahh.

700
01:01:39,439 --> 01:01:40,710
How the hell did I get here?

701
01:01:40,849 --> 01:01:42,347
What?
You came to us.

702
01:01:43,415 --> 01:01:44,878
-Who are you?
-Charles.

703
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:46,235
Charles Xavier.

704
01:01:46,658 --> 01:01:47,968
-I do not know you.
-Ahh?

705
01:01:48,393 --> 01:01:49,537
What the hell is that?

706
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,160
Wow, ho I can deal with this.

707
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:54,013
Just go.
Stop, Erik.

708
01:01:54,954 --> 01:01:55,621
Erik.

709
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:57,414
I'm sorry.

710
01:01:57,593 --> 01:01:58,241
Erik.

711
01:02:17,676 --> 01:02:19,379
You are Logan.
That's Hank McCoy.

712
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:20,306
I'm Charles Xavier.

713
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:22,310
You spent the last couple of days with us.

714
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:27,123
You're on Acid?

715
01:02:28,238 --> 01:02:30,992
Somebody gave you really bad acid.

716
01:02:31,907 --> 01:02:32,633
Yeah?

717
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:19,249
Just hold on tight we'll
get through this together.

718
01:03:21,184 --> 01:03:22,803
-Oh, God !
- Kitty.

719
01:03:24,122 --> 01:03:25,987
She is wounded pretty bad.

720
01:04:30,626 --> 01:04:31,946
I got him.

721
01:04:36,608 --> 01:04:37,540
Professor.

722
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,462
What happened to you?

723
01:04:40,734 --> 01:04:43,382
I just saw someone who's going to
bring me a lot of pain someday.

724
01:04:46,607 --> 01:04:47,665
Where is Raven?

725
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,785
Gone.

726
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,737
-What?
-We have to get out of here.

727
01:05:00,654 --> 01:05:05,271
Yesterday the paris peace summit was rocked
by the appearance of unidentified assailants.

728
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:07,438
<i> The likes of which the
world has never seen.</i>

729
01:05:07,761 --> 01:05:10,303
<i> Mass hysteria has gripped the
nation as people ask, </i>

730
01:05:10,557 --> 01:05:12,789
<i> Where did they come from?
Will they'd be back? </i>

731
01:05:13,018 --> 01:05:14,245
<i> And  most importantly, </i>

732
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:15,367
<i> Are they friend or foe? </i>

733
01:05:16,307 --> 01:05:20,320
 <i>That was one in corresponding to the earlier
reporting from the Paris Peace Summit yesterday.</i>

734
01:05:22,299 --> 01:05:23,447
What the hell are we dealing with here?

735
01:05:24,144 --> 01:05:25,305
Off the record.

736
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,845
Two days ago,

737
01:05:26,993 --> 01:05:31,977
This man Erick Lehnsherr escaped from a
maximum security prison inside the Pentagon.

738
01:05:32,024 --> 01:05:35,599
<i> We believe that this woman is a
former associate of lehnsherr's. </i>

739
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,162
They were together in cuba
the day of the crisis in 1962.

740
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:40,818
Hs was also linked to the
Kennedy assassination.

741
01:05:41,553 --> 01:05:42,645
What about that thing?

742
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:44,474
We do not know what that thing is, Sir.

743
01:05:44,777 --> 01:05:46,836
Actually we really don't
know what any of them are.

744
01:05:47,053 --> 01:05:47,819
Yes.

745
01:05:48,895 --> 01:05:50,129
Yes, We do.

746
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:51,537
They are mutants.

747
01:05:53,152 --> 01:05:56,792
He ​​has the power to control metal.

748
01:05:57,491 --> 01:06:00,194
Last I checked that's what most
of your weapons were made of.

749
01:06:00,618 --> 01:06:04,003
And she can transform into anyone.

750
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:05,478
A general.

751
01:06:05,782 --> 01:06:06,814
A secret service man.

752
01:06:07,143 --> 01:06:08,717
Even you, Mr. President.

753
01:06:09,421 --> 01:06:12,173
She can walk into this office,
and order a nuclear strike,

754
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,856
if she was in the mood.

755
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:16,109
And that's only two of them.

756
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,934
Well, do we have any
countermeasures, any defense?

757
01:06:19,073 --> 01:06:20,689
I was waiting for you to
ask me that question.

758
01:06:22,158 --> 01:06:25,838
That's an experimental program, Sir.
Strictly off the books.

759
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,445
You're telling me these
mutants are out in the world,

760
01:06:37,544 --> 01:06:40,135
And our best defense are
these giant metal robots?

761
01:06:40,236 --> 01:06:42,329
Many of the mutants looks like us.

762
01:06:42,681 --> 01:06:44,706
My sentinels can tell the difference.

763
01:06:45,198 --> 01:06:47,223
I have 8 prototypes ready to go,

764
01:06:47,598 --> 01:06:51,338
They're built out of a space
age polymer, not an ounce of metal on them.

765
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:59,200
I wanna make a demonstration,

766
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:01,772
I want the world
to know that we can protect them.

767
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,620
What do you need to get
these things operational?

768
01:07:03,713 --> 01:07:05,261
I already gave that number to congress

769
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,060
Unfortunately they elected to shut me down.

770
01:07:08,374 --> 01:07:11,031
It's going to cost a bit
more to turn them on.

771
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:11,886
Whatever you need.

772
01:07:12,019 --> 01:07:15,416
Oh, and one more thing, if we
do manage to capture them,

773
01:07:15,848 --> 01:07:19,737
I would like her for
research purposes of course.

774
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:26,679
Horrible.

775
01:07:28,381 --> 01:07:29,603
What is it?

776
01:07:29,928 --> 01:07:31,293
He was born like that.

777
01:07:31,827 --> 01:07:32,485
True?

778
01:07:33,252 --> 01:07:35,379
Just imagine ..

779
01:07:35,744 --> 01:07:37,688
Reflecting and see the ugly face like that?

780
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:40,190
I can imagine.

781
01:07:44,417 --> 01:07:46,175
Where did he come from?

782
01:07:47,384 --> 01:07:48,544
Did he have a family?

783
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:54,578
Yes, she does.

784
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:46,758
If I see so much as a screw
I'll jam this into your throat.

785
01:08:47,873 --> 01:08:49,225
How did you find me?

786
01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:50,696
You taught me well.

787
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,439
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

788
01:08:54,914 --> 01:08:56,154
I miss you.

789
01:08:56,782 --> 01:08:57,840
You tried to kill me.

790
01:08:58,394 --> 01:08:59,989
So the rest of us could live.

791
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,309
What do you mean?

792
01:09:03,856 --> 01:09:05,941
I received a message from the future.

793
01:09:06,077 --> 01:09:07,772
Don't lie to me.

794
01:09:08,373 --> 01:09:10,398
I never have, I never will.

795
01:09:12,422 --> 01:09:16,741
Humans use your blood, your genes to
create a weapon that wipes us all out.

796
01:09:17,526 --> 01:09:20,522
I was only doing what I thought
necessary to secure our future.

797
01:09:20,663 --> 01:09:23,835
So what's to stop me from killing you
right now and securing my future?

798
01:09:25,303 --> 01:09:26,001
Nothing.

799
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:28,962
It doesn't matter anymore.

800
01:09:29,524 --> 01:09:32,406
They have your DNA, your
blood was on the street.

801
01:09:33,346 --> 01:09:34,506
Whose fault is that?

802
01:09:36,217 --> 01:09:36,926
Mine.

803
01:09:38,598 --> 01:09:40,076
I've seen their plans.

804
01:09:40,582 --> 01:09:42,009
They are creating a weapon,

805
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:45,487
And now they have what they
need to take it further.

806
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:50,699
We have to strike now, while we have a
chance, while we still hold the upper hand.

807
01:09:53,547 --> 01:09:55,316
I've seen too many friends die, Eric.

808
01:09:57,535 --> 01:09:59,224
I don't want a war.

809
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,990
I only want the man who murdered them.

810
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,093
This is a war.

811
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:06,372
What happened to you?

812
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,413
Did you lose your way
when I was gone?

813
01:10:12,188 --> 01:10:14,260
Are you still Charles’s' Raven?

814
01:10:16,561 --> 01:10:18,529
Or are you Mystique?

815
01:10:22,474 --> 01:10:24,533
Trask is the enemy.

816
01:10:25,838 --> 01:10:27,897
Killing one man isn't enough.

817
01:10:28,592 --> 01:10:29,684
It never was for you.

818
01:10:31,152 --> 01:10:32,026
Good Bye, Erik.

819
01:10:57,903 --> 01:10:58,835
What happened?

820
01:10:59,677 --> 01:11:00,644
Can he walk?

821
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:01,806
He need his treatment.

822
01:11:02,297 --> 01:11:03,815
Hank, I can hear them.

823
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:06,359
It's ok, I'll make it stop. I'll get it

824
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:10,783
Hey, Hey. Pull yourself together

825
01:11:11,369 --> 01:11:12,572
It's not over yet.

826
01:11:16,478 --> 01:11:18,378
You don’t believe that?

827
01:11:19,892 --> 01:11:20,859
How do you know?

828
01:11:21,033 --> 01:11:22,091
As these go,

829
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:27,338
This coming back.

830
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:30,603
They all come back.

831
01:11:36,182 --> 01:11:37,033
Look, you know.

832
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:39,560
I'm still here.

833
01:11:40,913 --> 01:11:42,395
She's still out there.

834
01:11:44,783 --> 01:11:46,172
But we need your help, Charles.

835
01:11:47,417 --> 01:11:49,220
Not like this,
I need you.

836
01:11:49,545 --> 01:11:50,826
We can't  find Raven..

837
01:11:51,091 --> 01:11:52,091
..not without your powers.

838
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:58,961
I added a little extra
cause you missed a dose.

839
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:05,355
Charles.

840
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:38,385
Hank, do me a favour.

841
01:12:39,805 --> 01:12:41,520
Would you help me to my study please.

842
01:12:46,865 --> 01:12:48,373
Gonna get you.

843
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,619
Are you sure about this?

844
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:03,914
Absolutely not.

845
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,258
This creature is extraordinary.

846
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,491
Her genes could hold the
key to mutation itself.

847
01:13:18,501 --> 01:13:19,525
I need more.

848
01:13:19,743 --> 01:13:22,712
That's all they were able to scrape off
the pavement in Paris.

849
01:13:22,782 --> 01:13:23,875
More than blood.

850
01:13:24,696 --> 01:13:25,754
I need brain tissue.

851
01:13:26,441 --> 01:13:27,567
Spinal fluid.

852
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:29,552
Bone marrow.

853
01:13:30,355 --> 01:13:34,451
Imagine sentinels that could
transform, adapt to any target.

854
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:36,631
If I just get my hands on her.

855
01:13:36,929 --> 01:13:42,662
This girl could lead the program forward
years, decades into the future.

856
01:13:44,373 --> 01:13:45,533
How old is your son now, Major?

857
01:13:46,905 --> 01:13:47,578
Jason?

858
01:13:48,268 --> 01:13:50,166
He's coming up on 10 now
if you can believe it.

859
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:51,736
Eight years from fighting age.

860
01:13:52,135 --> 01:13:55,506
And how many of our sons and brothers did
we just ship home in body bags?

861
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:57,743
Maybe 50? 55000?

862
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:59,633
How many more in the other side?

863
01:14:00,995 --> 01:14:01,933
Never before,

864
01:14:02,987 --> 01:14:04,972
in all of human history,

865
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:10,192
Has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species?

866
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,135
Until now.

867
01:14:15,482 --> 01:14:17,541
You really hate mutants doctor, don't you?

868
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:22,600
On the contrary, I rather admire
them the things they can do.

869
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,535
I assume mutants as our salvation.

870
01:14:27,138 --> 01:14:28,162
And common enemy.

871
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:32,021
Common struggle against the ultimate enemy.

872
01:14:32,879 --> 01:14:34,279
Extinction.

873
01:14:35,202 --> 01:14:38,611
I believe our new friends are going
to help us usher in a new era, Bill.

874
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:43,726
A new era of genuine and
long lasting peace.

875
01:14:57,876 --> 01:14:59,620
<i> Attention! Attention! </i>

876
01:14:59,641 --> 01:15:01,846
<i> Transport departure
in two hours. </i>

877
01:15:01,847 --> 01:15:02,363
<i> Repeat. </I>

878
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,472
<i> Transport departure
begins in two hours. </i>

879
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:14,073
 When was the last time you down here?

880
01:15:14,826 --> 01:15:17,622
-Last time we went looking for students.
- A life time ago.

881
01:15:24,636 --> 01:15:25,762
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

882
01:15:49,728 --> 01:15:51,889
Raven is wounded, she won't be moving fast.

883
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:02,587
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

884
01:16:23,177 --> 01:16:24,114
Gosh!

885
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:32,610
<i>-No!
-Who are you?</i>

886
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:50,527
Charles!

887
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:00,157
Charles, It's alright.

888
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,734
I'll go check the generator.

889
01:17:13,779 --> 01:17:15,644
It's not the machinery, Is it?

890
01:17:15,847 --> 01:17:19,026
-I can't do this, my mind...
-Yes you can.

891
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,049
-It won't take it.
-It's just a little rusty.

892
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,280
You do not understand, It’s
not a question of being rusty.

893
01:17:23,354 --> 01:17:25,277
I can flip the switches,
I can turn the knobs.

894
01:17:25,419 --> 01:17:27,814
But my power comes from
here, comes from ..

895
01:17:29,612 --> 01:17:30,636
And it's broken.

896
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:33,486
I feel like one of my students.

897
01:17:34,539 --> 01:17:35,528
Helpless.

898
01:17:37,346 --> 01:17:40,291
It was a mistake coming down here.
It was a mistake freeing, Eric.

899
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:42,483
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

900
01:17:42,637 --> 01:17:45,110
I'm Sorry, Logan,
they sent back the wrong man.

901
01:17:45,811 --> 01:17:46,835
You're right.

902
01:17:48,814 --> 01:17:49,803
I’m.

903
01:17:51,228 --> 01:17:52,700
Actually it was supposed to be you.

904
01:17:53,852 --> 01:17:56,223
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

905
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:00,891
And ahh don't know how long we've got here.

906
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,042
But I do know that a long time actually,

907
01:18:04,787 --> 01:18:06,745
A long time from now.

908
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,302
I was your lost helpless student.

909
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:13,630
and you unlocked my mind.

910
01:18:13,839 --> 01:18:17,943
You showed me what I was,
you showed me what I could be.

911
01:18:18,744 --> 01:18:20,552
I don't know how to do that for you,

912
01:18:20,813 --> 01:18:22,064
You're right, I don't.

913
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,015
But I know someone who might.

914
01:18:28,854 --> 01:18:31,077
Look into my mind.

915
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:33,501
You saw what I did to Cerebro.

916
01:18:34,302 --> 01:18:35,647
You don't want me inside your head.

917
01:18:35,663 --> 01:18:38,316
There's no damage you can do.
That has already been done, trust me.

918
01:18:50,842 --> 01:18:51,408
Hey.

919
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:55,726
-Hey, Logan.
-Hey, Jean.

920
01:18:56,604 --> 01:18:58,161
-Kill me.
-I love you.

921
01:19:01,272 --> 01:19:03,082
You're a..

922
01:19:05,016 --> 01:19:06,432
..poor man.

923
01:19:06,543 --> 01:19:07,050
Look past me.

924
01:19:07,116 --> 01:19:11,983
I don't want suffering!
I don't want your future!

925
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:13,603
Pass my future.

926
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,639
Look for your future.

927
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:20,713
That's it.

928
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:22,679
That's it.

929
01:19:24,287 --> 01:19:24,991
That's it.

930
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,906
Charles.

931
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,602
Charles.

932
01:20:22,934 --> 01:20:24,667
So this is what become of us?

933
01:20:26,567 --> 01:20:27,714
Erik was right.

934
01:20:29,093 --> 01:20:31,016
Humanity does this to us.

935
01:20:31,217 --> 01:20:33,617
Not if we show them a better path.

936
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,517
You still believe?

937
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,277
just because someone
stumbles, loses their way,

938
01:20:39,743 --> 01:20:41,842
It doesn't mean they're lost forever.

939
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:46,415
Sometimes we all need a little help.

940
01:20:47,826 --> 01:20:49,408
I'm not the man I was.

941
01:20:51,796 --> 01:20:52,937
I opened my mind,

942
01:20:54,311 --> 01:20:56,687
It almost overwhelms me.

943
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:57,866
You're afraid.

944
01:20:58,663 --> 01:21:00,869
and Cerebro knows it.

945
01:21:01,471 --> 01:21:03,177
All those voices..

946
01:21:05,877 --> 01:21:10,371
So..... much...... pain.

947
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:12,908
It's not their pain you're afraid of.

948
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:16,353
It's yours Charles.

949
01:21:17,565 --> 01:21:19,724
And as frightening as it may be,

950
01:21:20,303 --> 01:21:22,312
That pain will make you stronger.

951
01:21:23,443 --> 01:21:25,832
If you allow yourself to feel it,

952
01:21:26,663 --> 01:21:28,313
embrace it.

953
01:21:29,668 --> 01:21:33,119
It will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined.

954
01:21:33,839 --> 01:21:37,127
It's the greatest gift we have,

955
01:21:37,495 --> 01:21:40,635
to bear their pain without breaking.

956
01:21:41,367 --> 01:21:45,071
And it's born from the most human power

957
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:47,550
Hope.

958
01:21:57,696 --> 01:21:58,649
Please,

959
01:21:59,251 --> 01:22:00,009
Charles,

960
01:22:00,096 --> 01:22:03,149
we need to hope again.

961
01:22:12,182 --> 01:22:14,126
Find what you were looking for?

962
01:22:20,372 --> 01:22:21,439
Power is back on.

963
01:22:21,868 --> 01:22:22,483
Yes.

964
01:22:24,233 --> 01:22:25,288
Yes it is.

965
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:07,790
She's lost too much blood.

966
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:11,233
-She can't keep going like this
-We have no choice, Bobby.

967
01:24:12,082 --> 01:24:13,011
We can wake him up.

968
01:24:13,076 --> 01:24:13,766
No.

969
01:24:15,044 --> 01:24:16,232
They need more time.

970
01:24:16,906 --> 01:24:21,568
I had a glimpse into the past,

971
01:24:21,683 --> 01:24:26,519
If we wake logan now we may set off an
even darker course.

972
01:24:26,692 --> 01:24:28,153
They need more time.

973
01:24:47,858 --> 01:24:49,768
Raven, stop.

974
01:24:50,589 --> 01:24:51,485
Stop running.

975
01:24:52,475 --> 01:24:53,232
Charles.

976
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:56,597
Where are you?

977
01:24:56,875 --> 01:24:57,907
Back at the house.

978
01:24:58,096 --> 01:24:59,643
..where you should be.

979
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,116
I need you to come home.

980
01:25:02,746 --> 01:25:04,465
I know what I need to do.

981
01:25:08,693 --> 01:25:09,533
If you kill Trask,

982
01:25:09,591 --> 01:25:11,747
You will be creating
countless more just like him.

983
01:25:12,255 --> 01:25:13,458
Then I'll kill them too.

984
01:25:13,643 --> 01:25:15,827
Those are Erick's works not yours.

985
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:22,246
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing,

986
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,861
She was good, fair, full of compassion.

987
01:25:27,195 --> 01:25:30,102
I have compassion,
just not for Trask.

988
01:25:30,302 --> 01:25:32,098
<i>He's murdered too many of us. </i>

989
01:25:36,477 --> 01:25:38,005
Shut her down Charles, get in her head.

990
01:25:38,469 --> 01:25:42,637
She's not letting me in I'm barely holding on.
I'm not strong enough yet.

991
01:25:51,152 --> 01:25:52,794
I know what Trask has done.

992
01:25:53,736 --> 01:25:55,761
But, killing him will not bring them back.

993
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,564
it will set you on a path from which
there is no return

994
01:26:00,429 --> 01:26:02,165
An endless cycle of killing

995
01:26:02,352 --> 01:26:04,150
us and them,

996
01:26:04,321 --> 01:26:05,860
 till there is nothing left.

997
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:09,324
But we can stop it  right now.

998
01:26:09,524 --> 01:26:10,524
You and I.

999
01:26:12,006 --> 01:26:14,284
<i> You just have to come home. </i>

1000
01:26:16,144 --> 01:26:17,177
I have to .

1001
01:26:18,468 --> 01:26:20,205
You haven't changed at all, Charles.

1002
01:26:21,082 --> 01:26:22,298
<i> Like I said. </i>

1003
01:26:22,498 --> 01:26:24,508
I know exactly what I have to do.

1004
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:40,870
Where is he?

1005
01:26:41,562 --> 01:26:43,744
At an airport boarding a plane.

1006
01:26:43,983 --> 01:26:45,651
Plane to where?

1007
01:26:48,209 --> 01:26:49,880
Washington DC.

1008
01:26:51,778 --> 01:26:52,892
Hey guys,

1009
01:26:53,661 --> 01:26:55,911
There is something I need to show to you.

1010
01:26:57,639 --> 01:26:59,447
<i>We're going backwards in time.</i>

1011
01:26:59,718 --> 01:27:02,885
This the system I designed to
record any news about Paris,

1012
01:27:03,188 --> 01:27:05,449
over all 3 networks and PBS.

1013
01:27:05,962 --> 01:27:07,672
All three? wow

1014
01:27:07,993 --> 01:27:09,626
Yeah and PBS.

1015
01:27:10,771 --> 01:27:11,863
Look what I found.

1016
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:15,428
Tomorrow in front of the white house the
president will make his announcement .

1017
01:27:15,665 --> 01:27:18,026
He'll be joined by secretary
of defense Blair.

1018
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:21,550
And has even sought the help of
renowned scientist Bolivar Trask.

1019
01:27:21,741 --> 01:27:24,383
<i>His special adviser to combat
this mutant issue. </I>

1020
01:27:24,769 --> 01:27:26,092
<i> White House is.... </i>

1021
01:27:26,455 --> 01:27:31,040
Raven doesn't realize but if she kills trask at
an event like that with the whole world watching

1022
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:34,968
Then I came a long way for nothing.

1023
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:38,255
And there's more bad
news, I saw in a report.

1024
01:27:38,523 --> 01:27:40,477
They found traces of her blood in paris.

1025
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,189
<i>for all we know they
already have her DNA </i>.

1026
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:44,569
<i> That's all they need, </i>

1027
01:27:44,769 --> 01:27:46,596
to create the
sentinels in the future.

1028
01:27:50,381 --> 01:27:53,587
Now there's a theory in time
physics that time is immutable.

1029
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:59,011
It's like a river, you can throw a pebble and it will
create a ripple but the current always corrects itself.

1030
01:28:00,214 --> 01:28:03,936
No matter what you do the river just
keeps flowing in the same direction.

1031
01:28:04,593 --> 01:28:05,767
What are you trying to say?

1032
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,248
I was saying is..

1033
01:28:08,268 --> 01:28:09,456
what if the war is inevitable.

1034
01:28:09,882 --> 01:28:11,681
What if she's meant to kill Trask.

1035
01:28:13,227 --> 01:28:15,675
What if this is just simply who she is.

1036
01:28:18,099 --> 01:28:21,399
Just because someone
stumbles, loses their way.

1037
01:28:22,203 --> 01:28:23,985
Doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1038
01:28:29,143 --> 01:28:31,112
I don't believe that  theory, Hank.

1039
01:28:33,047 --> 01:28:35,174
And I can not believe that who she is.

1040
01:28:37,586 --> 01:28:40,085
Ready the plane
we're going to washington.

1041
01:28:42,338 --> 01:28:44,401
Washington. D.C.

1042
01:29:58,966 --> 01:29:59,896
You alright ?

1043
01:30:00,134 --> 01:30:01,192
Getting there.

1044
01:30:06,499 --> 01:30:09,007
Whatever happens today, I need
you to promise me something.

1045
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:13,036
You looked into my mind and you've seen
a lot of bad but,

1046
01:30:13,948 --> 01:30:15,293
You've seen the good too.

1047
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:17,471
The X-Men.

1048
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:20,909
Promise me you'll find us.

1049
01:30:23,057 --> 01:30:25,035
Use your power, bring us together.

1050
01:30:25,665 --> 01:30:27,334
Guide us. Lead us.

1051
01:30:29,427 --> 01:30:30,107
Storm,

1052
01:30:30,896 --> 01:30:31,740
Scott,

1053
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:35,218
Jean.

1054
01:30:37,037 --> 01:30:38,374
Remember those names.

1055
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,309
There's so many of us.

1056
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,171
We will need you, Professor.

1057
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:50,520
I will do my best.

1058
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:52,043
Your best is enough.

1059
01:30:54,529 --> 01:30:55,408
Trust me.

1060
01:31:18,201 --> 01:31:20,466
12 carriers inbound, 10 miles.

1061
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:23,338
They found us.

1062
01:31:39,781 --> 01:31:44,585
<i> Thousands of people will be gathered here, they
come from all over the world witness history </i>

1063
01:31:44,647 --> 01:31:48,182
Along with news crews from
at least 50 different countries.

1064
01:31:49,758 --> 01:31:50,468
Thank you.

1065
01:31:53,556 --> 01:31:55,098
Can I see your invitations please?

1066
01:31:55,797 --> 01:31:57,008
Yes you may..

1067
01:31:57,117 --> 01:31:58,328
these two are with me.

1068
01:31:58,554 --> 01:31:59,543
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1069
01:32:07,246 --> 01:32:07,970
<i> Logan. </i>

1070
01:32:08,626 --> 01:32:09,974
Please, this way, sir.

1071
01:32:34,886 --> 01:32:35,786
It's fine...

1072
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:38,984
I haven't found her yet
but she has to be here.

1073
01:32:39,138 --> 01:32:40,981
<i> President of the United States. </i>

1074
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,897
My fellow Americans,

1075
01:33:05,589 --> 01:33:10,049
<i> Today we face the greatest
threat in our history. </i>

1076
01:33:10,385 --> 01:33:11,136
Mutants.

1077
01:33:11,721 --> 01:33:12,720
<i>I'm pregnant..</i>

1078
01:33:14,596 --> 01:33:16,674
We have prepared for this threat.

1079
01:33:19,995 --> 01:33:22,870
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer.

1080
01:33:23,745 --> 01:33:24,838
Behold..

1081
01:33:25,465 --> 01:33:28,416
The world will never be the same again.

1082
01:33:58,934 --> 01:33:59,866
Can I help you?

1083
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,084
No, you can't.

1084
01:34:41,977 --> 01:34:42,948
Here they come.

1085
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,815
<i>This for you brothers and sisters. </i>

1086
01:34:54,847 --> 01:34:55,386
Raven.

1087
01:34:58,415 --> 01:34:59,541
I have her.

1088
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,527
Let me go, Charles.

1089
01:35:03,452 --> 01:35:04,802
There.
You see?

1090
01:35:05,229 --> 01:35:07,252
Secret service man
left to the stage.

1091
01:35:07,324 --> 01:35:08,285
-Got it.
-Go.

1092
01:35:29,157 --> 01:35:30,807
What the hell are you doing?

1093
01:35:30,889 --> 01:35:32,450
I didn't tell you to activate it.

1094
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:33,354
I didn't.

1095
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,844
Raven, please listen to me.

1096
01:35:54,673 --> 01:35:57,882
<i>We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.</i>

1097
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:02,124
Don't do this.

1098
01:36:03,688 --> 01:36:05,281
********

1099
01:36:07,999 --> 01:36:10,160
Gentlemen, you cannot pass this point.

1100
01:36:18,444 --> 01:36:19,661
We can't stop that many.

1101
01:36:20,216 --> 01:36:20,694
No.

1102
01:36:21,104 --> 01:36:22,803
But, we can slow them down.

1103
01:37:00,944 --> 01:37:02,716
Erik!

1104
01:37:38,253 --> 01:37:39,614
Move it ! Comon let's go!!

1105
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:48,788
Storm!

1106
01:38:25,671 --> 01:38:29,280
<i> Take us to Def-con 3.
Mr. President we are code red. </i>

1107
01:38:29,351 --> 01:38:30,500
<i> Air defense ready now. </i>

1108
01:38:32,057 --> 01:38:33,458
<i> What the hell happened out there? </i>

1109
01:38:33,484 --> 01:38:34,370
I'll fix it.

1110
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:35,757
You said that before,

1111
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:36,977
I wanted to make a statement.

1112
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:39,622
<i> Now the whole goddamn world knows
we can't protect them.</i>

1113
01:38:40,127 --> 01:38:41,319
<i>I will fix it. </i>

1114
01:38:41,338 --> 01:38:42,338
<i>You damn well better.</i>

1115
01:39:54,275 --> 01:39:55,242
Charles!

1116
01:40:46,047 --> 01:40:47,434
Is everybody okay?

1117
01:41:21,593 --> 01:41:22,610
Storm!

1118
01:41:26,489 --> 01:41:27,545
Behind you.

1119
01:42:11,957 --> 01:42:12,740
Now.

1120
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,619
I'm probably not supposed to
ask this kind of a thing.

1121
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:42,181
But in the future,
do I make it?

1122
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:43,534
No.

1123
01:42:45,933 --> 01:42:47,705
But we can change that, right?

1124
01:42:59,566 --> 01:43:01,340
Do what you were made for.

1125
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:03,617
Mutants.

1126
01:43:10,795 --> 01:43:11,734
Where are you?

1127
01:43:29,777 --> 01:43:31,409
I got this. Go.

1128
01:44:15,392 --> 01:44:16,603
Oh dear god, no.

1129
01:44:32,394 --> 01:44:34,531
So much for being a survivor.

1130
01:45:17,559 --> 01:45:18,811
One of them is in here.

1131
01:45:21,412 --> 01:45:22,324
<i>No! No! No! </i>

1132
01:45:22,414 --> 01:45:23,186
<i> Don't kill it. </i>

1133
01:45:23,465 --> 01:45:24,521
I need it alive.

1134
01:45:38,108 --> 01:45:39,579
What the hell has happened?

1135
01:46:47,363 --> 01:46:49,567
You built  these weapons to destroy us.

1136
01:46:50,502 --> 01:46:51,435
Why?

1137
01:46:55,986 --> 01:46:58,674
Because you're afraid of our gifts.

1138
01:46:59,457 --> 01:47:01,043
Because we are different.

1139
01:47:01,147 --> 01:47:03,097
Humanity has always feared that
which is different.

1140
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:06,549
But I'm here to tell you, tell the world.

1141
01:47:07,959 --> 01:47:09,818
You're right to fear us.

1142
01:47:10,610 --> 01:47:11,697
<i>We are the future.</i>

1143
01:47:12,804 --> 01:47:15,351
We are the ones who will
inherit this earth.

1144
01:47:16,012 --> 01:47:18,092
And anyone who stands in our way,

1145
01:47:18,137 --> 01:47:22,142
Will suffer the same fate as
these men you see before you.

1146
01:47:29,132 --> 01:47:32,521
Today was meant to be a
display of your power.

1147
01:47:32,831 --> 01:47:38,421
Instead I give you a glimpse of the
devastation my race can unleash upon yours.

1148
01:47:47,494 --> 01:47:50,387
<i>Let this be a warning to the world. </i>

1149
01:47:50,659 --> 01:47:53,739
<i> And to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there, </i>

1150
01:47:54,236 --> 01:47:55,832
<i> I say this: </i>

1151
01:47:56,078 --> 01:47:57,602
<i> No more hiding. </i>

1152
01:47:58,062 --> 01:47:59,786
<i> No more suffering. </i>

1153
01:48:00,971 --> 01:48:06,431
You've lived in a shadows in shame
and fear too long. Come out.

1154
01:48:07,352 --> 01:48:12,346
<i> Join me, fight together in the
brotherhood of our kind. </i>

1155
01:48:12,837 --> 01:48:14,597
New tomorrow.

1156
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:18,045
..that starts today.

1157
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:28,749
All those years wasted fighting
each other, Charles

1158
01:48:32,388 --> 01:48:35,949
To have a precious few of them back.

1159
01:49:14,924 --> 01:49:15,487
Mr. President.

1160
01:49:15,535 --> 01:49:17,275
Stand down ! I said stand down!

1161
01:49:19,918 --> 01:49:21,536
You want to make a statement?

1162
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:23,791
<i>  Kill me...finally </i>

1163
01:49:24,215 --> 01:49:26,026
<i> But spare everyone else! </i>

1164
01:49:38,626 --> 01:49:40,455
Very heroic, Mr. President.

1165
01:49:41,448 --> 01:49:44,115
But you had no intention
of sparing any of us.

1166
01:49:45,372 --> 01:49:48,803
The future of our
species begins now.

1167
01:49:53,181 --> 01:49:53,726
<i>Mutant</i>

1168
01:49:58,064 --> 01:49:59,012
<i>Mutants</i>

1169
01:50:24,145 --> 01:50:25,379
You used to be a better shot.

1170
01:50:25,437 --> 01:50:26,778
Trust me, I still I'm.

1171
01:50:40,279 --> 01:50:41,890
Get out of my head, Charles!

1172
01:50:42,145 --> 01:50:42,833
Raven,

1173
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:45,747
Please do not make us the enemy
today.

1174
01:50:46,061 --> 01:50:47,731
Look around you, we already are.

1175
01:50:48,093 --> 01:50:49,873
They not all of us.

1176
01:50:50,362 --> 01:50:52,017
All you've done so far

1177
01:50:52,156 --> 01:50:54,669
Is save the lives
of these men.

1178
01:50:55,648 --> 01:50:57,958
You can show them a better path.

1179
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,740
Shut her down, Charles

1180
01:51:05,766 --> 01:51:08,967
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met.

1181
01:51:09,697 --> 01:51:11,424
And look what that's got us

1182
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:16,397
Everything that happens now,

1183
01:51:17,217 --> 01:51:18,544
is in your hand.

1184
01:51:23,814 --> 01:51:26,347
I have a faith in you, Raven.

1185
01:53:04,874 --> 01:53:06,438
He's all yours, Charles.

1186
01:53:34,743 --> 01:53:36,935
If you let them have me
I'm as good as dead.

1187
01:53:37,366 --> 01:53:38,377
You know that.

1188
01:53:39,443 --> 01:53:40,172
I know.

1189
01:53:43,122 --> 01:53:44,154
Good-bye, old friend.

1190
01:53:47,169 --> 01:53:48,302
Good-bye, Erik.

1191
01:54:22,618 --> 01:54:24,168
You sure you should let them go?

1192
01:54:25,608 --> 01:54:26,208
<i> Yes. </I>

1193
01:54:27,508 --> 01:54:28,847
<i> I have hope for them. </I>

1194
01:54:30,465 --> 01:54:32,059
<i> It's going to be a time, Hank. </I>

1195
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:33,888
When we're all together.

1196
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:39,610
<i> What about Logan? </I>

1197
01:56:09,875 --> 01:56:12,200
Good morning, Logan.
Late start. Hah hah ha.

1198
01:56:22,584 --> 01:56:24,752
<i> Have a good lunch time.
Good job. </i>

1199
01:56:24,838 --> 01:56:26,777
-Thank you.
-Very good job.

1200
01:56:28,226 --> 01:56:29,151
<i> Storm. </I>

1201
01:57:00,563 --> 01:57:01,231
Jean.

1202
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:04,049
Hi, Logan.

1203
01:57:06,871 --> 01:57:07,928
Are you okay?

1204
01:57:10,189 --> 01:57:11,061
You're here.

1205
01:57:12,205 --> 01:57:13,308
Where else would I be?

1206
01:57:16,654 --> 01:57:17,443
Woh.

1207
01:57:18,438 --> 01:57:19,438
Easy, pal.

1208
01:57:22,154 --> 01:57:23,390
Some things never change.

1209
01:57:25,944 --> 01:57:26,971
Good to see you, Scott.

1210
01:57:29,337 --> 01:57:30,056
Ah ha.

1211
01:57:30,373 --> 01:57:31,444
See you later, Jean.

1212
01:57:35,747 --> 01:57:36,712
Professor.

1213
01:57:37,784 --> 01:57:38,424
Logan.

1214
01:57:39,332 --> 01:57:40,413
Is everything alright?

1215
01:57:44,151 --> 01:57:44,575
Yeah.

1216
01:57:46,643 --> 01:57:48,055
Yeah, I think it is.

1217
01:58:05,069 --> 01:58:05,898
You did it.

1218
01:58:06,606 --> 01:58:07,239
Did what?

1219
01:58:07,653 --> 01:58:09,321
Logan, don't you have a class to teach?

1220
01:58:10,462 --> 01:58:11,169
A class?

1221
01:58:11,605 --> 01:58:12,658
To teach. What?

1222
01:58:13,041 --> 01:58:13,847
History.

1223
01:58:14,682 --> 01:58:15,355
History?

1224
01:58:17,085 --> 01:58:18,592
History, I could use some help with that.

1225
01:58:19,194 --> 01:58:20,203
Help with what?

1226
01:58:20,854 --> 01:58:24,069
Pretty much everything after 1973.

1227
01:58:29,263 --> 01:58:31,822
I think history I know
is little different.

1228
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:34,973
Welcome back.

1229
01:58:38,221 --> 01:58:39,549
It's good to see you, Charles.

1230
01:58:41,439 --> 01:58:42,484
It's good to see everyone.

1231
01:58:43,091 --> 01:58:43,997
Well,

1232
01:58:45,297 --> 01:58:46,726
I had a promise to keep.

1233
01:58:48,584 --> 01:58:51,747
You and I have lot of catching up to do.

1234
01:58:52,762 --> 01:58:53,323
Yes.

1235
01:58:57,946 --> 01:58:59,695
What is the last thing you remember?

1236
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:06,044
Drowning.

1237
01:59:15,241 --> 01:59:16,444
<i> The past, </i>

1238
01:59:17,781 --> 01:59:20,637
<i> a new and uncertain world. </i>

1239
01:59:32,427 --> 01:59:35,060
<i> A world  of endless possibilities. </i>

1240
01:59:37,327 --> 01:59:39,503
<i>  and infinite outcomes. </i>

1241
01:59:41,296 --> 01:59:42,218
<i>Can we?</i>

1242
01:59:42,429 --> 01:59:43,603
<i>Oh he is alive!</i>

1243
01:59:43,958 --> 01:59:45,063
<i>He is breathing</i>

1244
01:59:48,213 --> 01:59:51,177
<i> Countless choices define our fate. </i>

1245
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:56,819
<i> Each choice, each moment a
ripple in the river of time.</i>

1246
01:59:57,249 --> 01:59:59,110
What do you want us to do with him,
Major Striker?

1247
02:00:00,019 --> 02:00:03,102
<i> Enough ripples and you
change the tide.</i>

1248
02:00:04,478 --> 02:00:05,586
I'll take him from here.

1249
02:00:05,876 --> 02:00:09,656
<i>For the future is never truly set.</i>
